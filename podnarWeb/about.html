                                Currently pursuing a comprehensive program that bridges application development and network 
                                infrastructure. The SDNE curriculum provides a dual-track education covering both software 
                                engineering principles and network architecture fundamentals.

                    <p>
                        As a first-year student, I am actively building my technical foundation and seeking opportunities to 
                        apply classroom knowledge in real-world environments. I am particularly interested in <strong>co-op

                        <h4>Long-Term Vision:</h4>
                        <p>
                            In 3-5 years, I aim to be working in <strong>cybersecurity</strong> or <strong>network infrastructure</strong>, 
                            where I can apply both my development skills and networking knowledge to protect and optimize critical systems. 
                            I'm particularly drawn to roles where understanding code helps me identify vulnerabilities, and networking 
                            expertise enables me to secure infrastructure from the ground up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately, I see myself in positions like <strong>Security Operations Engineer</strong>, 
                            <strong>Network Security Analyst</strong>, <strong>Penetration Tester</strong>, or 
                            <strong>Infrastructure Security Specialist</strong>. I want to be the person who can trace a security incident 
                            from the application layer through the network stack, implement defense-in-depth strategies, and architect 
                            secure network designs that protect against evolving threats.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My dual focus on software development and network engineering uniquely positions me to understand attack vectors 
                            from multiple angles—whether that's exploiting application vulnerabilities, analyzing network traffic for 
                            anomalies, or hardening infrastructure configurations. I'm building toward a career where security isn't just 
                            a checklist, but a fundamental mindset applied to every layer of the technology stack.

                    <h2 class="story-heading">Personal Philosophy & Approach</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Curiosity over Comfort:</strong> I actively seek challenges that push me outside my knowledge zone. 
                        The discomfort of not knowing is temporary; the growth from learning is permanent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Documentation & Knowledge Sharing:</strong> I believe in writing clear documentation, commenting 
                        code thoughtfully, and sharing knowledge with others. Teaching reinforces understanding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Systems Thinking:</strong> Technology doesn't exist in isolation. Understanding how components 
                        interact—from user experience to database performance to network latency—creates better solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Every project is an opportunity to refine skills. I regularly 
                        review my code, identify areas for improvement, and implement better practices in subsequent projects.
